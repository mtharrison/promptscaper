# ![promptscaper](./public/logo_black_small.png)  PromptScaper

A client-only OpenAI LLM Playground for building agents without writing any code.

You can save (in IndexedDB) and reopen workspaces later or export and share with a coworker.

The goal of this project is to enable you to explore how function calling can improve your agents _before_ investing in actually deciding what those functions need to do. You just type in the function response as text.
